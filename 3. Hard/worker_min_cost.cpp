// Leetcode problem statement link
// https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-hire-k-workers/

// There are n workers. You are given two integer
// arrays quality and wage where quality[i] is the
// quality of the ith worker and wage[i] is the
// minimum wage expectation for the ith worker.

// We want to hire exactly k workers to form a
// paid group. To hire a group of k workers, we
// must pay them according to the following rules:

// Every worker in the paid group must be paid at
// least their minimum wage expectation. In the
// group, each worker's pay must be directly
// proportional to their quality. This means if a
// workerâ€™s quality is double that of another worker
// in the group, then they must be paid twice as much
// as the other worker.
// Given the integer k, return the least amount of
// money needed to form a paid group satisfying the
// above conditions. Answers within 10-5 of the
// actual answer will be accepted.
